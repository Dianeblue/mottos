<p>Featured Image: the cosmic ice sculptures of the Carina Nebula via Hubblesite.
The visible space is big, complex and can be incredibly beautiful. This list of 9 pictures gathers the most beautiful images of our universe I could find.  Even though these pictures taken from space may look like surreal landscapes, they are not entirely created by computer. Note that for some images, infrared electromagnetic waves have been transmitted over the visible spectrum. The following images can be downloaded in high quality to be used as wallpapers.</p>

<p>A solar flare is a sudden brightening observed over the Sun’s surface. This picture captured by the NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory  illustrates one of these beautiful prominences. This phenomena sent out particles and a third radiation belt that traveled near Earth a few days later.</p>

<p>This is also the Carina Nebula. It was taken by a team of astronomers with Hubble’s cameras. It is a 50-light-year-wide view of the central region of the Carina Nebula where a maelstrom of star birth – and death – is taking place.</p>

<p>Stephan’s Quintet consists of a compact group of five galaxies which are going to collide with each other. These galaxies are interesting for scientists because of these collisions.</p>

<p>Messier 83 (also known as M83 or NGC 5236) is a barred spiral galaxy approximately 15 million light years from Earth in the constellation Hydra. NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory has discovered an extraordinary outburst by a black hole in this galaxy.

<p>This Small Magellic Cloud is considered as a dwarf irregular galaxy. It has a diameter of about 7,000 light-years and contains several hundred million stars. This cloud is very small compared to the Milky Way, our 100,000 light years galaxy.</p>
